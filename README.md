# FAF Cab Management Platform - Communication Contract

This document outlines the communication contracts for the microservices within the FAF Cab Management Platform. All services that require user authentication or user-specific information will validate requests using a **JWT (JSON Web Token)** provided in the `Authorization` header.

---
## Overview

The FAF Cab Management Platform is designed to improve the organization and operational efficiency of FAF Cab, with modular microservices for user management, communication, booking, consumable tracking, fundraising, and more. Each microservice encapsulates a specific domain to ensure modularity, independence, and maintainability.

Microservices are implemented using multiple technologies to optimize performance and leverage language-specific strengths:

* **Java/Spring Boot:** User Management, Notification, Budgeting, Fundraising, Sharing
* **Elixir:** Communication Service, Tea Management, Lost & Found, Budgeting
* **JavaScript/Node.js:** Cab Booking, Check-in

| Vieru Mihai      | Lost & Found, Budgeting          | Elixir          | PostgreSQL     | REST, Asynchronous notifications, WebSocket (Phoenix Channels) | Elixir’s ability to handle high concurrency and fault tolerance is ideal for budget and lost & found services that require reliable multi-user interaction and asynchronous notifications. Phoenix Channels enable efficient real-time communication. Functional programming paradigm ensures maintainable, scalable code.            |
| Polisciuc Vlad   | Tea Management Service, Communication Service | Elixir        | PostgreSQL     | REST, Async notifications                | Elixir excels at real-time, low-latency systems. Its lightweight processes and OTP supervision enhance fault tolerance, perfect for consumable tracking and live chat. Phoenix supports WebSocket-based communication, crucial for the communication service’s real-time messaging and moderation features.                             |
| Ungureanu Vlad   | Cab Booking, Check-in            | Node.js, Express           | PostgreSQL     | REST, Async loops, External API integration (Google Calendar)   | Node.js is exceptionally well-suited for applications like booking systems due to its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model. When the system needs to perform an action that relies on an external service, such as fetching data from the Google Calendar API, it sends the request and immediately proceeds to handle other tasks without waiting for a response. This asynchronous capability means the application doesn't get stuck, allowing its lightweight runtime to efficiently manage many simultaneous user requests. The result is a highly responsive scheduling service that remains fast and available even under heavy load.                                           |
| Tapu Pavel       | Fundraising, Sharing             | Java, Spring Boot          | PostgreSQL     | REST with JWT auth, Async notification queues | Java and Spring Boot provide a mature, secure, and scalable framework for handling critical business workflows like fundraising and item sharing. Strong security features (JWT auth) and stable async processing suit admin-controlled services requiring transactional integrity and complex business logic.                         |
| Copta Adrian     | User Management, Notification    | Java, Spring Boot          | PostgreSQL     | REST, Async event-driven updates        | The Spring ecosystem offers robust authentication (including JWT), authorization, and notification capabilities critical for user and notification management. Because of high developer productivity and strong integration with databases and enterprise security standards, it makes ideal for core identity and communication services.       |

# Architectural Diagram of Microservices operation

![alt text](microserv-1.jpg)
The diagram above illustrates the microservices architecture designed for the FAFCab system. It highlights how different services, such as Notification Service, Communication Service, Budgeting Service, Fund Raising Service, Tea Management Service, and User Management Service, interact with each other through the API Gateway and Service Registry. Each service is responsible for a specific function, ranging from financial tracking and consumable management to user check-ins, booking, and lost-and-found operations. The modular design ensures that responsibilities are clearly separated, making the system scalable, maintainable, and easier to extend with new features as needed.

## Branch Structure

### Main Branches
- **`main`** - Production-ready code, always deployable
- **`development`** - Integration branch for features, staging environment

### Branch Protection Rules
- **Approvals Required**: 2 reviewers minimum
- **Dismiss Stale Reviews**: Enabled (reviews are dismissed when new commits are pushed)
- **Branch must be up to date**: Required before merging

## Branch Naming Convention

We follow a standardized naming pattern for all feature branches:

```
type/short-description-issueID
```

### Branch Types
| Prefix | Purpose | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `feature/` | New functionality | `feature/user-authentication-23` |
| `bugfix/` | Bug fixes | `bugfix/header-alignment-15` |
| `hotfix/` | Critical production fixes | `hotfix/server-crash-18` |
| `refactor/` | Code restructuring | `refactor/database-optimization-45` |
| `docs/` | Documentation updates | `docs/api-documentation-12` |
| `chore/` | Maintenance tasks | `chore/dependency-updates-8` |

### Naming Guidelines
- Use lowercase letters and hyphens
- Keep descriptions concise but descriptive
- Always include the related issue number
- Use present tense for actions

## Merging Strategy

**Strategy**: Squash and Merge

### Benefits
- Clean, linear commit history
- Combines all commits from a feature branch into a single commit
- Easier to track features and revert if necessary
- Reduces noise in the main branch history

### Process
1. Create feature branch from `development`
2. Make commits with clear, descriptive messages
3. Open Pull Request to `development`
4. After approval, squash and merge
5. Delete feature branch after merge

## Pull Request Requirements
